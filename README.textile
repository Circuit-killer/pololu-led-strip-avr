h2. Summary

This is example AVR C code for controlling the addressable RGB LED strips from Pololu:

* "Addressable RGB LED Strip: One-Wire Interface, 5V, 1m":http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/2543
* "Addressable RGB LED Strip: One-Wire Interface, 5V, 2m":http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/2544
* "Addressable RGB LED Strip: One-Wire Interface, 5V, 5m":http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/2545

This version of the code does NOT work with the older, low-speed LED strips (items #2540, #2541, and #2542).  If you have one of those, you should use the version of this code from commit edc9e9d (committed on 2013-05-09).

This code allows complete control over the color of an arbitrary number of LED strips with an arbitrary number of LEDs.  Each LED can be individually controlled, and LED strips can be chained together.
